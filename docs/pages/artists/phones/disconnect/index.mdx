# Disconnect a Phone Number

This page documents the API endpoint for disconnecting a phone number from an artist's profile on the In Process protocol.

## Overview

Artists can disconnect their connected phone number from their profile. This will remove the phone number association and disable SMS-based features for that number.

## Endpoint

```http
DELETE https://inprocess.world/api/phones
```

## Authentication

Include an API key in the x-api-key header for authorization:

```http
x-api-key: <artist_api_key>
```

See [Create an Artist API Key](/artists/api-keys/create) for how to create API keys.

## Request Body

No request body is required. The phone number to disconnect is determined by the authenticated artist's address.
