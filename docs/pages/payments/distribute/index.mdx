# Distribute the Payment

This page documents the API endpoint for distributing payments from a split contract. This endpoint allows you to trigger the distribution of payment tokens (native or ERC20) from a split contract to its recipients according to their configured allocations.

## Endpoint

```http
POST https://inprocess.world/api/distribute
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Request Body

The request body must be sent as JSON with `Content-Type: application/json`.

| Name         | Type   | Required | Default | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| splitAddress | string | Yes      | —       | The address of the split contract to distribute from                       |
| tokenAddress | string | Yes      | —       | The address of the token to distribute (use zero address for native token) |
| chainId      | string | No       | 8453    | Chain ID where the split contract exists (default: Base, 8453)             |

## Example Requests

:::code-group

```bash [cURL]
# With chainId (optional, defaults to 8453)
curl -X POST https://inprocess.world/api/distribute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    "tokenAddress": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",  # Zero address for native token
    # chainId is optional, defaults to 8453 (Base)
    # "chainId": "8453"

  // chainId is optional, defaults to 8453 (Base)
  // chainId: "8453"
};

const response = await fetch("https://inprocess.world/api/distribute", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```typescript [TypeScript]
interface DistributeParams {
  splitAddress: string;
  tokenAddress: string;
  chainId?: string; // Optional, defaults to "8453" (Base)
}

const payload: DistributeParams = {
  splitAddress: "0x4b4324bcC6dB9380ABBbbD20B24A16C11FB5B38A",
  tokenAddress: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", // Zero address for native token
  // chainId is optional, defaults to "8453" (Base)
};

const response = await fetch("https://inprocess.world/api/distribute", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

## Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "hash": "0xTransactionHash"
}
```

## Notes

- Use the zero address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) for `tokenAddress` when distributing native tokens (ETH)
- For ERC20 tokens, provide the contract address of the token
- The payment distribution will split funds according to the allocations configured in the split contract
- The transaction hash returned can be used to track the payment distribution onchain
