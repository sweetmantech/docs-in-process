## Splits Configuration Reference

The `splits` object defines how revenue from moment sales will be distributed among multiple recipients. This configuration is optional.

### Splits Structure

```json
{
  "splits": {
    "recipients": [
      "0xRecipient1",
      "0xRecipient2",
      "0xRecipient3"
    ],
    "percentAllocations": [5000, 3000, 2000]
  }
}
```

### Fields

- **`recipients`**: Array of Ethereum addresses that will receive a share of the revenue
- **`percentAllocations`**: Array of percentages in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%). The sum must equal 10000 (100%)

### Important Notes

- The splits contract owner will be set to the creator's smart wallet
- If `splits` is provided, the `payoutRecipient` in the token configuration will be automatically set to the splits contract address
- If `splits` is not provided, you can optionally specify a `payoutRecipient` directly in the token configuration
- The `percentAllocations` array must have the same length as the `recipients` array
- The sum of all `percentAllocations` must equal exactly 10000 (representing 100%)

### Example: Two-Way Split

```json
{
  "splits": {
    "recipients": ["0xRecipient1", "0xRecipient2"],
    "percentAllocations": [6000, 4000] // 60% and 40%
  }
}
```

### Example: Three-Way Split

```json
{
  "splits": {
    "recipients": [
      "0xRecipient1",
      "0xRecipient2",
      "0xRecipient3"
    ],
    "percentAllocations": [5000, 3000, 2000] // 50%, 30%, and 20%
  }
}
```
