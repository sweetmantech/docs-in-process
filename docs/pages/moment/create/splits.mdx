## Splits Configuration Reference

The `splits` object defines how revenue from moment sales will be distributed among multiple recipients. This configuration is optional.

### Splits Structure

```json
{
  "splits": {
    "recipients": ["0xRecipient1", "0xRecipient2", "0xRecipient3"],
    "percentAllocations": [50, 30, 20]
  }
}
```

### Fields

- **`recipients`**: Array of Ethereum addresses that will receive a share of the revenue
- **`percentAllocations`**: Array of percentages (0-100). The sum must equal 100. The backend API will validate this value.

### Important Notes

- The splits contract owner will be set to the creator's smart wallet
- If `splits` is provided, the `payoutRecipient` in the token configuration will be automatically set to the splits contract address
- If `splits` is not provided, you can optionally specify a `payoutRecipient` directly in the token configuration
- The `percentAllocations` array must have the same length as the `recipients` array
- The sum of all `percentAllocations` must equal exactly 100. The backend API will validate this value.

### Example: Two-Way Split

```json
{
  "splits": {
    "recipients": ["0xRecipient1", "0xRecipient2"],
    "percentAllocations": [60, 40] // 60% and 40%
  }
}
```

### Example: Three-Way Split

```json
{
  "splits": {
    "recipients": ["0xRecipient1", "0xRecipient2", "0xRecipient3"],
    "percentAllocations": [50, 30, 20] // 50%, 30%, and 20%
  }
}
```
