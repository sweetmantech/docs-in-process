## Splits Configuration Reference

The `splits` array defines how revenue from moment sales will be distributed among multiple recipients. This configuration is optional.

### Splits Structure

`splits` is an array of objects, where each object contains:

- **`address`**: The recipient's Ethereum address
- **`percentAllocation`**: The percentage allocation (0-100)

```json
{
  "splits": [
    {
      "address": "0xRecipient1",
      "percentAllocation": 50
    },
    {
      "address": "0xRecipient2",
      "percentAllocation": 30
    },
    {
      "address": "0xRecipient3",
      "percentAllocation": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

### Important Requirements

- Must have at least 2 recipients
- All `percentAllocation` values must sum to exactly 100%
- Each recipient address must be a valid Ethereum address
- The backend API will validate these requirements

### Important Notes

- The splits contract owner will be set to the creator's smart wallet
- If `splits` is provided, the `payoutRecipient` in the token configuration will be automatically set to the splits contract address
- If `splits` is not provided, you can optionally specify a `payoutRecipient` directly in the token configuration

### Example: Two-Way Split

```json
{
  "splits": [
    {
      "address": "0xRecipient1",
      "percentAllocation": 60
    },
    {
      "address": "0xRecipient2",
      "percentAllocation": 40
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example: Three-Way Split

```json
{
  "splits": [
    {
      "address": "0xRecipient1",
      "percentAllocation": 50
    },
    {
      "address": "0xRecipient2",
      "percentAllocation": 30
    },
    {
      "address": "0xRecipient3",
      "percentAllocation": 20
    }
  ]
}
```
